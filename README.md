## Don't run this as is
You will get banned. There is new anti-cheat. My private closed-source platform (temsharp.com) bypasses this.

## How to Run
- Download https://github.com/shalzuth/TemSharp/releases/download/beta/TemSharp.Loader.exe
- Launch Game
- Launch Exe, this will download https://github.com/shalzuth/TemSharp/tree/master/TemSharp and inject it
- In game, when you have cursor (escape, tab, main menu, etc), you can enable/disable mods

## Available Mods
- Disable Fights
- Heal
- Monster Info
- Open Bank
- Open Shop
- Shiny Hunter
- Speed
- Teleporter
- Zoom

## Disable Fights
Only works in grass. Working on Trainer fight bypassing.

## Heal
Heals your little guys up to full.

## Monster Info
Shows SV info in battle.

## Open Bank
Swap your Temtems on the fly.

## Open Shop
Forget pokeballs? Buy them on the fly.

## Shiny Hunter
Start mod in grass.
Mod will:
* Start fight
* Fight or Flee
* Repeat until a Shiny Pokeman is found, or minimum SV values are found
Has option to disable graphics during battle.

## Speed
Speeds up the game. Could be modified to make it go slower if there are requests.

## Teleporter
Don't use in buildings/caverns
Right Click on map to teleport to location
Right Click on ground to teleport to mouse

Using the numpad, 2, 4, 6, 8 will teleport you a couple blocks away.

## Zoom
Pulls Mr Cameraman back a bit. And cleans up the blur effect.

## Remove Name
Removes your name from appearing on the HUD.

## Extra
I also left a clientless project in here. Goodluck getting it to work :)

## Donate coffee and/or beer
I probably won't mix them.
